This is a Python based app that uses tkinter as UI.
It can:
+ Calculate solutions, Vertex and coefficients for quadratic funtions.
+ Display graph for a given function (doesn't have to be quadratic)
+ You can change color of the background in settings.
+ I'm also working on implementing a window where user can input data such as x1, x2, 
coefficients and the program will output every bit of possible data that the user didn't give.
